- Checked if the package was published with TypeScript types
- Initially found that the package was not generating type declarations during build
- Modified the build script in package.json to use the `--dts` flag with tsup
- Successfully generated TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) for all source files
- The package is now configured to publish with types, with the main type declaration file set to `dist/index.d.ts`
