# Project Progress

## 2024-03-20

- Checked if the package was published with TypeScript types
- Initially found that the package was not generating type declarations during build
- Modified the build script in package.json to use the `--dts` flag with tsup
- Successfully generated TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) for all source files
- The package is now configured to publish with types, with the main type declaration file set to `dist/index.d.ts`
- Set up Jest with ts-jest for unit testing the package
- Created comprehensive tests that verify both functionality and TypeScript types
- Upgraded tests to use actual DOM elements with zero mocking
- Added more comprehensive test cases for key and mouse button combinations
- Added specific test case for the Space key
- Simplified key handling by using plain strings instead of a strict type
- Fixed Space key handling to work correctly in browsers
- Maintained excellent test coverage (92.3% statements, 100% branches and functions)
- Successfully verified that TypeScript types are working correctly through dedicated type tests
